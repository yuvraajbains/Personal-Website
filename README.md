# Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains my personal portfolio website source code. The site showcases selected projects, skills, work experience, and a little summary of who I am as a Software Engineering student currently in my third year at Carleton University.

## Purpose

The site is a lightweight, front-end portfolio intended to present projects and professional information with an emphasis on clarity and readable UI. It is optimized for quick edits so projects and links can be updated without changing layout code.

## Key technologies

- React (JSX)
- Material UI (MUI) for layout and components
- react-icons for branded icons
- Plain CSS and custom fonts for styling

## Notable features

- Responsive project showcase with interactive cards and GitHub links
- Animated section titles and subtle UI transitions
- Simple, componentized structure for easy content updates
- Resume download available in `public/`
